    "1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk\n",
    "There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.\n",

    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.\n",

    "Instead of iterating through the array to find the first index, we can use binary search. Binary search is ideal here because it quickly narrows down the search space in a sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining a predicate function that checks if the prefix sum at a given index is greater than the k modulo sum. This function returns true for indices where the prefix sum exceeds the target and false otherwise. Since the array is sorted based on the prefix sums, true indicates indices with no chalk left, while false indicates indices with some chalk remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using binary search, we locate the smallest index where the predicate returns true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the predicate returns true, it means there might be smaller indices with true values, so we adjust the upper bound of the search space to the current index.\n",
    "If the predicate returns false, it means all true values are beyond the current index, so we adjust the lower bound of the search space to the current index.\n",
